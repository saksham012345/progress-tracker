# Note-Taking Strategies for Computer Science

## The Cornell Method
Split your page into three sections:
- **Cues (Left)**: Keywords, questions, or main ideas.
- **Notes (Right)**: Main points, diagrams, and detailed explanations.
- **Summary (Bottom)**: A brief 2-3 sentence summary of the page.

## Flow-Based Notes
Don't write linear text. Connect ideas with arrows and lines. This is great for:
- Algorithms
- System Architecture
- Database Relationships

## Code Snippets
Always write pseudo-code first. Don't worry about syntax. capture the *logic*.
```python
def learn(topic):
    while not understood:
        practice()
        ask_questions()
    return mastery
```
